# ATM Interface Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code for an ATM Interface project developed during my internship at [Company Name]. The project simulates basic ATM functionalities, including user authentication, balance inquiry, deposits, and withdrawals. The application is built using Java and follows object-oriented programming principles to ensure modularity and ease of maintenance.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login using a username and PIN.
- **Balance Inquiry:** Display the current balance of the user.
- **Deposits:** Allow users to deposit money into their account.
- **Withdrawals:** Enable users to withdraw money, ensuring sufficient balance is available.
- **Transaction History:** View a log of recent transactions.
- **Error Handling:** Informative messages for incorrect PINs, insufficient funds, and other errors.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** Core language used for development.
- **Swing:** For building the graphical user interface.
- **File I/O:** To handle user data and transaction history.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/atm-interface.git
   cd atm-interface
   ```

2. **Compile the Code:**
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
